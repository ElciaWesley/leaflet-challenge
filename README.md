The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
______________________________________________
With the earthquake data from this past week being visualized, the map will help the government efficiently allocate resources and funding to specific geographic locations. Additionally, it helps governments establish proper building code and reinforcement measures that will help mitigate the impact of future earthquakes.

Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data
______________________________________________
By overlaying earthquake data onto tectonic plate boundaries, this map offers insights into the underlying mechanisms driving seismic events, aiding in the prediction of future earthquakes. Also, this map can help government officials identify earthquake anomalies that may come from non-tectonic activities like fracking. This capability is critical for ensuring the responsible management of industrial processes and safeguarding communities against potential risks. By correlating seismic events with human activities, authorities can implement regulations and monitoring protocols to mitigate the impact of induced earthquakes and protect both infrastructure and the environment.
